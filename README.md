## Hola chat!!!!

As I mentioned, I'll be out for a bit, but here's the repo!

## Learning Materials

The turbo docs will be the best place to get started as they act as a nice baseline to the ecosystem!

[Click here to check out info on Turbo!](https://docs.turbo.computer/)

Additionally, since this project is using TurbECS as a general manager, refer to these docs if you have any questions. (Note: The docs have some gaps, so if yopu have any questions, just shoot me a ping!)

[Click here for the TurbECS docs!](https://github.com/EdwardLe0n/TurbECS)

Once you're ready to develop, you'll need to, get a turbo os dev key!

- Finally, if you have any questions that can't be answered through these channels, just shoot me a ping!
